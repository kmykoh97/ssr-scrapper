## Installation of Required Libraries  
If you are using normal distribution of python, you don't have to install anything. All required packages are included in standard Python distribution  

If you are using some special port of Python such as [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) you have to install required packages using pip.  
First update pip:  
**On Mac or Linux**  
```
pip install -U pip setuptools
```
**On Windows**  
```
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
```
Then install libraries:  
pip install
